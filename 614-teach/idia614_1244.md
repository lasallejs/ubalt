### Required Materials
- Internet access, computer with a camera, Zoom.
- On digital reserve: *Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art* by Scott McCloud. ISBN: 9780060976255         


### Assignments
In order to help build your portfolio, there will be large assignments and several smaller ones that deal with one overarching project. The projects are individual and are NOT group projects.           
         
**Process Flow**         
You will use a software tool of your choice to design a process flow diagram. The diagram will illustrate a series of steps that includes procedures, conditions, and parallel activities.  

**Journey Map**
Creating a visual timeline of your design's experience is an important skillset to have. You will use a tool of your choice to create a time-based breakdown of your proposed design's experience.       
         
**User stories**
This is a brief assignment where you will follow modern Agile methods to create user stories for your design.

**AI Assisted Ideation**  
This assignment will have you utilize Large Language Models to create text and visuals to support your ideas.

**Design Fiction**  
Students will use techniques of design fiction to explore interactive spaces and ideas for their projects.

**Storyboards**         
You will **hand draw** a series of storyboards that shows a user going through the process you illustrated in the first assignment. The storyboards will not just show screens, but will also include the context the user is in and their actions. This activity will draw on the \emph{Understanding Comics} text as well as the *Paper Napkin* book.         
         
**Animated Storyboards**         
You will use a camera/phone/VHS camcorder to *record* your storyboards as video or "animations". You will include a narration of what is going on. You can use Windows Movie Maker, iMovie, or any other tool for this. It needs to be better than just recording something with your phone but you don't need any special equipment beyond what your computer should have (e.g. a microphone).         

**Icon Design**
You will use industry standard guidelines to design an icon.         

**Final Presentation**         
You will present your final project in whole to the class in 5-10 minutes.         
         
**Smaller Assignments**         
These will be smaller activities assigned as homework. They include topic definition and a rough draft (and others). It is also reserved in case we need any extra reinforcement of a topic.

### Course expectations

This is an advanced course that emphasizes practical, hands-on activities. Throughout the semester, the class will use multiple methods to create a holistic design. Unlike a traditional course, this class is highly dynamic, and readings may be adjusted as necessary based on the directions of the class designs.

It's important to understand while this appears to be typical lecture-based course, you cannot simply attend and absorb information. The success of this course depends heavily on your active participation and engagement. You'll be expected to contribute to critiques, peer reviews, and be flexible as the course project evolves. Your involvement is crucial in making this course a meaningful and productive experience for everyone.



### Philosophy
#### The Value of Messy Assignments

"The creative process can often be intimidating, challenging, and unpredictable. But, with the right mindset, the creative mess can be navigated successfully. Embracing uncertainty is the key to unlocking the potential of creativity. By accepting the little mistakes, missteps, and even occasional dead ends, we can learn to work more effectively with the chaos of creativity and turn it into something positive." - Joe Dager, [Embracing Uncertainty: Navigating The Creative Mess](https://business901.com/blog1/embracing-uncertainty-navigating-the-creative-mess/)

In this course, we recognize that the design process is rarely linear or pristine. We value experimentation, iteration, and the occasional detour into the unknown. Expect to encounter challenges, uncertainties, and moments where the path forward isn't immediately clear. This is not a sign of failure, but rather an essential part of the design journey. Embrace the mess, question assumptions, and allow your creativity to flourish amidst the ambiguity.

Assignments in this class may be intentionally open-ended, inviting you to forge your own path and make your own discoveries. Don't be afraid to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. The most valuable lessons often come from the unexpected twists and turns along the way. Remember, the goal is not simply to produce a polished final product, but to cultivate a resilient and adaptable design mindset that will serve you well throughout your career.

In this course, you will encounter assignments that may feel **ambiguous**, **unstructured**, or **"messy."** This approach is intentional and mirrors the complexities of real-world design challenges. In professional practice, you won't always receive neatly packaged problems with clear instructions. Instead, you will often face **vague** or **open-ended** situations that require you to **define the problem**, **explore possibilities**, and **iterate on solutions**.

#### Why Messy Assignments Matter

- **Embracing Ambiguity:** Design is inherently uncertain. Messy assignments teach you to be comfortable with ambiguity, fostering the ability to **make decisions** and **move forward** without always having all the answers upfront.

- **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving:** These assignments push you to think **critically** and **creatively**. You'll learn to **identify and frame problems**, **explore multiple solutions**, and **critically evaluate** your work and the work of others.

- **Real-World Preparation:** In the design industry, clients and stakeholders rarely provide **fully-formed problems**. The skills you develop through messy assignments will prepare you to **tackle real-world projects** where you must **define the scope**, **identify challenges**, and **navigate complexity**.

- **Resilience and Adaptability:** Facing and overcoming uncertainty builds **resilience**. You will become more **adaptable** and **resourceful**, qualities that are highly valued in the design field.

#### Navigating Messy Assignments

- **Trust the Process:** It's normal to feel **discomfort** or **frustration** with ambiguous tasks. Trust that these feelings are part of the learning process. The goal isn't to find the **"right" answer** but to **explore possibilities** and **learn from each iteration**.

- **Collaboration and Feedback:** Use your **peers** and **myself** as resources. **Collaboration** and **constructive feedback** are essential in refining your ideas and finding direction.

- **Reflect and Iterate:** Regular **reflection** on your process and outcomes is key. *Document your thought process, decisions, and iterations*. This not only helps you understand your own work better but also provides a **roadmap for improvement**.

Remember, the journey through **uncertainty** and **complexity** is where some of the most **innovative** and **meaningful designs** emerge. These messy assignments are designed not just to **challenge you** but to help you grow into a **resilient**, **thoughtful**, and **skilled designer**, capable of navigating the complexities of the design world.

"An excellent way to make great work is to not be afraid of making bad work." - Mitch Goldstein, p 73 *How to Be a Design Student*

#### Case Study
>In the early 1990s, a team of engineers at Apple was tasked with developing a new portable music player. At the time, portable music players were relatively large and clunky, and the market was dominated by devices like the Sony Walkman. The Apple team was faced with a number of ambiguities and uncertainties in the development process, including a lack of clear direction from management, constantly changing technology and market trends, and limited resources.    

>To navigate these ambiguities, the team had to think creatively and come up with novel solutions to the problems they faced. They experimented with different designs and technologies, and were open to considering alternative approaches and perspectives. This process of exploration and experimentation led to the development of the iPod, which revolutionized the portable music player market and became one of the most successful consumer electronics products of all time."

### **Course Policies**
- **Attendance**: Participation in the on-campus research week and regular attendance in class are required to pass the course. Please notify the instructor in advance if you need to miss a class. *Faure due to Attendance (FA) is due to:*
  - 
  - Missing four classes in total or three in a row without contacting me.
- **Camera**: I am required by law to say if you attended or did not attend classes. I can not know if you are actually attending unless your camera is on.
  - your camera is turned on for the class lecture and discussion or the away (coffee cup) symbol is present. 
  - You log off when dismissed (unless you want to ask a question or chat...that's ok with me!). If I have to keep saying "You can log off now" and there is no response, I can only assume you are not there and weren't there for the class.        

- **Late Work**: Late submissions will not be accepted unless prior arrangements are made in advance due to exceptional circumstances.
- **Academic Integrity**: All work must be original and properly cited. Plagiarism or misrepresentation of attendance will result in disciplinary action. We will be using AI responsibly.
- **Chat in class**: Please don't use the chat in class to ask questions or have a running sidebar conversation. It is extremely distracting to me and other students. Please use the chat to post a link or send a direct message to me if you want to ask something or tell me something. All other in-class communications should be out loud if you are able.

### Equal Access
I have ADHD. Technically, I have *combined type* ADHD. I was recently diagnosed and realized I'd spent my whole life trying to work within a world that doesn't quite work with me. That being said, I can't understand the challenges that can come with others' disabilities (including ADHD in others). However, I try to treat everyone with empathy and respect. I'm here to support you the best I can.

**Disability and Access Services**

If you have a documented disability that requires accommodations, please contact the Center for Educational Access at (410) 837‐4775 or via email at cea@ubalt.edu. The office is located in the Academic Center, room 139. This office provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations for students with documented disabilities.            

**Please note**:  I am legally obligated to follow the recommendations provided by DAS. I am committed to creating an inclusive learning environment, but it is important to understand that DAS is the official channel for determining and implementing accommodations.

### Addendum
Per Section VII-3.2 of the University of Baltimore's Policy Guide, please find an addendum with additional resources available [here](http://www.ubalt.edu/policies/academic/Student-Success-Resources-Syllabus-Addendum.pdf).
