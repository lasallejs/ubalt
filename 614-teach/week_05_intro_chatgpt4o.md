## Slide 5: Challenges of AI in Design
- Creativity Concerns: Does AI limit human creative control or augment it?
- Ethical Issues: Bias in AI systems can lead to biased design outputs.
- Over-reliance on AI: Designers may lose critical thinking and problem-solving skills if they over-rely on AI for decision-making.
- Data Privacy: Using AI for personalization raises concerns about how user data is collected and used.
