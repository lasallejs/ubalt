5:30 - 5:45 PM:  What's New?

Briefly touch on any relevant announcements or current events.
Kick off with a quick icebreaker to get everyone thinking creatively. Something like: "If you could design one object to solve a problem in your daily life, what would it be?" Have a few people share their ideas.
5:45 - 6:15 PM: Design Fiction Primer

What is it? - Keep this concise, focusing on the core concept: using design and storytelling to speculate about possible futures.
Why does it matter? Highlight its power to:
Explore potential consequences of emerging tech.
Spark critical thinking about the world around us.
Inspire innovation and problem-solving.
Show, don't just tell! Instead of lengthy explanations, use compelling examples:
A short, impactful clip from a film like Minority Report or Her.
Images of intriguing design fiction objects (e.g., The Ambiguous Utopia project).
6:15 - 7:15 PM:  Interactive Activity: "Future Artifacts"

The Setup:
Divide the class into small groups (3-5 people).
Provide each group with a set of prompts or themes related to future trends (e.g., artificial intelligence, climate change, biotechnology).
The Task:
Each group brainstorms and designs a "future artifact" â€“ an object from their chosen future scenario.
Encourage them to think about its function, appearance, materials, and the story behind it.
They can sketch, write descriptions, or even use readily available materials to create a basic prototype.
7:15 - 7:45 PM:  Sharing and Discussion

Have each group present their "future artifact" to the class.
Facilitate a discussion around their creations:
What problems does this artifact solve or create?
What are the ethical implications of this technology?
How might this object change people's lives?
