### Factual Questions
1. What is the core definition of "Design Fiction" as proposed by Bruce Sterling?
2. How does "world-building" in design fiction differ from traditional storytelling according to Coulton et al.?
3. In the "Game of Drones" design fiction, what was the primary role of drones in the fictional trial?
4. What ethical concerns are raised by the "Game of Drones" design fiction example?
5. How does the concept of "diegetic prototypes" play a role in the definition of design fiction?
6. What role do "imaginary abstracts" serve in Mark Blythe's approach to Research through Design?

### Synthesis Questions
7. How does the "Game of Drones" design fiction example reflect real-world concerns about surveillance and civic enforcement?
8. Compare the use of narrative in traditional prototypes versus design fiction prototypes. How do they serve different purposes?
9. Both papers emphasize the importance of prototypes in design research. How do design fiction prototypes differ in their purpose from traditional HCI prototypes?
10. How does the exploration of empathy in the "Voight-Kampff Machine" design fiction challenge current technological advancements in emotion detection?
11. What similarities and differences can you find between the "Empathy Engine" and real-world empathic technologies being researched today?

### Opinion Questions
12. Do you agree with the argument that "world-building" is more critical to design fiction than narrative? Why or why not?
13. What potential pitfalls do you see in presenting design fictions that are indistinguishable from reality, as with the "Game of Drones" submission to a real HCI conference?
14. Blythe criticizes the commercial pressures on academic design research. Do you think design fiction can serve as a counterbalance to these pressures? Why or why not?
15. How effective do you think imaginary abstracts are as a way to evaluate research prototypes without building them?
16. How do you think the public might react to a system like the "Game of Drones"? Would it be accepted or rejected, and why?

### Open-ended Questions
17. How could the ideas from these design fiction papers be applied to create interactive elements for our LGBTQ+ exhibit that blend real and speculative historical scenarios?
18. How can the "world-building" approach of design fiction help us explore untold stories or underrepresented communities in our exhibit?
19. How might incorporating empathy-driven technology, as seen in the "Empathy Engine," enhance visitor engagement with the themes of inclusion in our exhibit?
20. Considering the focus on fictional technologies and alternate realities, how could design fiction help us craft speculative futures for marginalized communities in our exhibit?
